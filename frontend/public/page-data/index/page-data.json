Although networking technologies have become increasingly ubiquitous over the past two decades, until recently they have largely been restricted to connecting traditional end-user devices, such as mainframes, desktop and laptop computers, and, more recently, smartphones and tablets.\n\nRecent years have witnessed the attachment of a much broader range of devices to the network. These have included vehicles, household appliances, medical devices, electric meters and controls, street lights, traffic controls, smart TVs and digital assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Industry analysts estimate that there are currently more than eight billion such devices connected to the network and project that this number will expand to more than 25 billion by 2020. The increasing deployment of these devices has enabled new use cases for network technologies. Some experts project that the IoT may generate as much as US$13 trillion in revenue by 2025.\n\n## Industry analysts estimate that there are currently more than eight billion such devices connected to the network and project that this number will expand to more than 25 billion by 2020.\n\nUnlike traditional cyber systems, which connect general-purpose computers, IoT systems often link together highly specialized devices designed for specific purposes with only a limited degree of programmability and customizability. In addition, IoT systems often store and process data in a distributed manner, in contrast to the highly centralized approach of consolidating storage and computing power in large data centres. In addition, IoT systems are sometimes called cyber-physical systems, because unlike purely cyber systems, they also include sensors that collect data from the physical world.\n\nThe distributed nature and the presence of physical sensors create both new opportunities and vulnerabilities from the standpoint of security and privacy. To date, however, the industry, end-users and the academic community have only just begun to appreciate what the burgeoning deployment of this technology might mean and to study how to prepare for the challenges posed by this new technological environment."}}]}},{"node":{"id":"0e1ea0fa-59f7-5aa3-a4a1-975f54f3bd2b","title":"Hippo Roller for Water & Sanitation","createdAt":"2023 March 25","image":"https://ik.imagekit.io/pgaiwwz36/production/images/thumbnail_DSC_0007_096ec83f49_lMEUMdnHc.JPG?updatedAt=1678445927859","slug":"the-hippo-roller-is-a-drum-designed-to-transport-up-to-90-liters-of-water-more-easily","blocks":[{"childStrapiComponentSharedRichTextBodyTextnode":{"body":"# Key Features\n\n\nThe Hippo Roller is a simple and appropriate technology designed to transport 90 liters of water much more easily than by carrying heavy 20-liter buckets or jerry cans. \n\nThe drum is designed to cope with tough rural conditions while rolling a heavy weight of water over sandy and rocky footpaths, which have broken glass and barbed wire, for long distances with an average life-span of 5-7 years, and often much longer.\n\nThe weight is spread across the wide rolling surface making it easier to roll through mud and soft sand while reducing the wear and tear. Grains of sand embedded on the rolling surface add an additional layer of protection.\n\nThe steel handle clips into recesses at each end of the large drum enabling people to simply roll it along the ground. The drum can be pushed or pulled depending on the terrain and two people can pull the same drum up steep hills if need be. \n\nThe large opening allows the drum to be cleaned properly and yet is small enough to prevent toddlers from falling inside. There is a mini-cap inside the large cap for simple irrigation of agriculture and the hygienic withdrawal of water. \n\nThe Hippo Roller also provides a flexible infrastructure for accessing multiple water points which often change throughout the year.\n\n\n# Social Impact\n\n\n\nThe UN says 2.1 billion people do not have access to safe water in their homes forcing them to collect and carry all the water they need back home. This task falls mainly to women and children who are the primary water carriers in the household. The elderly are often forced to rely on the goodwill of neighbors as they are unable to carry heavy containers of water.\n\nTo date, some 60,000 units have been distributed in 51 countries, directly impacting hundreds of thousands of people and many more indirectly.\n\nApart from the obvious alleviation of the daily struggle to carry water, perhaps the biggest benefit the Hippo Roller brings is more time. The Hippo Roller frees up many hours each day for other important tasks in the home. Time spent at water collection point queues is reduced.\n\nChildren who need to collect water in the mornings are able to attend school on time resulting in an improved level of education, increasing employment opportunities to break free of the poverty cycle.\n\nMothers have more time to tend to their childrenâ€™s needs and maintain their homes.\n\nMore water means a better quality of life and empowers households to improve their hygiene and health, grow small-scale food gardens, and generate an income from the sale of excess crops and water delivery services. \n\n"}}]}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
