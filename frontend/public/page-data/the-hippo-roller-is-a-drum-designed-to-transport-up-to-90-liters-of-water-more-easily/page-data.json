Grains of sand embedded on the rolling surface add an additional layer of protection.\n\nThe steel handle clips into recesses at each end of the large drum enabling people to simply roll it along the ground. The drum can be pushed or pulled depending on the terrain and two people can pull the same drum up steep hills if need be. \n\nThe large opening allows the drum to be cleaned properly and yet is small enough to prevent toddlers from falling inside. There is a mini-cap inside the large cap for simple irrigation of agriculture and the hygienic withdrawal of water. \n\nThe Hippo Roller also provides a flexible infrastructure for accessing multiple water points which often change throughout the year.\n\n\n# Social Impact\n\n\n\nThe UN says 2.1 billion people do not have access to safe water in their homes forcing them to collect and carry all the water they need back home. This task falls mainly to women and children who are the primary water carriers in the household. The elderly are often forced to rely on the goodwill of neighbors as they are unable to carry heavy containers of water.\n\nTo date, some 60,000 units have been distributed in 51 countries, directly impacting hundreds of thousands of people and many more indirectly.\n\nApart from the obvious alleviation of the daily struggle to carry water, perhaps the biggest benefit the Hippo Roller brings is more time. The Hippo Roller frees up many hours each day for other important tasks in the home. Time spent at water collection point queues is reduced.\n\nChildren who need to collect water in the mornings are able to attend school on time resulting in an improved level of education, increasing employment opportunities to break free of the poverty cycle.\n\nMothers have more time to tend to their childrenâ€™s needs and maintain their homes.\n\nMore water means a better quality of life and empowers households to improve their hygiene and health, grow small-scale food gardens, and generate an income from the sale of excess crops and water delivery services. \n\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"the-hippo-roller-is-a-drum-designed-to-transport-up-to-90-liters-of-water-more-easily"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
